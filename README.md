In order to execute the code in the robot, execute the `execution` script within `patrol_robot_delevopment` directory.
For that, it is necessary to give it execution permission and have the packages `xdotool` and `wmctrl` installed.
Just copy the command below:
```bash
$ chmod +x patrol_robot_development/execution.sh
$ ./patrol_robot_development/execution.sh
```
